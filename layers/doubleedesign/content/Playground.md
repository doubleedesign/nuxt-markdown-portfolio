# Playground

This is the playground page. It is a place to test out new ideas and experiment with design elements. This is some placeholder text for doing just that. You can find the rest of the placeholder text below and get more at [Friends Ipsum](https://doubleedesign.github.io/friends-ipsum/).

What if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fall in love? I mean, wouldn't that be a great story?

Smelly cat, smelly cat, it's not your fault Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to. I just stopped and I said, what if I don't want to be a shoe? What if I want to be a purse, you know, or a hat? 

What? Go back? To the land where time stands still? Be sleepy! And grumpy! Stop naming dwarves! Three bathrooms in this place, and I threw up in a coat closet. Just to be clear, comedy with the plates will not be well-received.

- Well, the fridge broke, so I had to eat everything.
- Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffee house. First of all, the customer is always right. A smile goes a long way. And if anyone is ever rude to you: Sneeze Muffin.
- We might still have some money if your father hadn't thought it was a good idea to sell ice over the internet. 

I was backpacking through western Europe... I wanna quit the gym! They're different from my other friends, they don't start sentences with "you know who just died shoveling snow?"

## Heading 2: The messers become the messees. 

I understand why Superman is here, but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny's funeral? 

Be sleepy! And grumpy! Stop naming dwarves! So it seems like this internet thing is here to stay. That’s a great story. Tell it while you’re getting me some iced tea. If it's not a right angle, it's a wrong angle. They're different from my other friends, they don't start sentences with "you know who just died shoveling snow?" Hey, that’s jo-incidence with a C! I wanna quit the gym!
